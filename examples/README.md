# NodeTalk Deployment Examples

This directory contains example configurations for deploying NodeTalk in different environments.

## Available Examples

### 1. [Production (Docker Compose)](./docker-compose/production/)
A standalone setup using pre-built images from Docker Hub. Ideal for quick production deployments without needing to build from source.

*   **Images Used**: `mjn81/nodetalk-server` and `mjn81/nodetalk-webclient`.
*   **Requirements**: Docker and Docker Compose.
*   **Setup**: Just copy the `docker-compose.yml` and `config.toml`, then run `docker-compose up -d`.
